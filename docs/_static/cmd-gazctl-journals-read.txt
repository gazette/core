Usage:
  gazctl [OPTIONS] journals [journals-OPTIONS] read [read-OPTIONS]

Read the contents of one or more journals.

A label --selector is required, and determines the set of journals which are read.
See "journals list --help" for details and examples of using journal selectors.

Matched journals are read concurrently, and their content is multiplexed into
the output file (or stdout). Content is copied to the output in whole-fragment
chunks, and so long as journal appends reflect whole message boundaries, this
command will also respect those boundaries in the merged output.

The --selector is evaluated both at startup and also periodically during
execution. As new journals are matched by the selector, and old ones stop
matching, corresponding read operations are started and stopped.

Journals are read until the write-head is reached (OFFSET_NOT_YET_AVAILABLE),
or gazctl is signaled (Ctrl-C or SIGTERM). If --block is specified, reads will
block upon reaching the write-head and thereafter stream content as it commits.

By default reads of journals begin at byte offset 0. If --offsets is specified,
it must exist and be a JSON mapping of journal name to read offset, and is used
to supply the initial read offsets for selected journals. --offsets-out in turn
is a path to which final journal offsets are written on exit (either due to
Ctrl-C or because all available content has been read). If --offsets and
--offsets-out are the same path, the existing offsets will be retained and
moved to a ".previous" suffix.

If --tail is specified and a journal is not present in --offsets, then its read
begins at its current write-head. This option generally only makes sense with
--block, but can also be used to initialize --offsets-out.

When running in high-volume production settings, be sure to set a non-zero
--broker.cache.size to significantly reduce broker load. Aside from controlling
the cache size itself, a non-zero value will:
* Disable broker-side proxying of requests, such that gazctl directly routes and
dispatches to applicable brokers, and
* Turn of broker proxy reads of fragment files in backing stores. Instead,
gazctl will read directly from stores via signed URLs that brokers provide.

When client-side reads of fragments stored to a 'file://' backing store are
desired, use the --file-root option to specify the directory of the store (eg,
this might be the local mount-point of a NAS array also used by brokers).

Examples:

# Read all available journal content:
gazctl journals read -l name=my/journal

# Streaming read from tail of current (and future) journals matching my-label:
gazctl journals read -l my-label --block --tail

# Read new content from matched journals since the last invocation. Dispatch to
# brokers in our same availability zone where available, and directly read
# persisted fragments from their respective stores:
echo "{}" > offsets.json # Must already exist.
gazctl journals read -l my-label -o output --offsets offsets.json --offsets-out offsets.json --broker.cache.size=256 --zone=us-east-1


Application Options:
      --zone=                        Availability zone within which this process is running (default: local) [$ZONE]

Logging:
      --log.level=[info|debug|warn]  Logging level (default: info) [$LOG_LEVEL]
      --log.format=[json|text|color] Logging output format (default: text) [$LOG_FORMAT]

Help Options:
  -h, --help                         Show this help message

[journals command options]

    Broker:
          --broker.address=          Service address endpoint (default: http://localhost:8080) [$BROKER_ADDRESS]
          --broker.cache.size=       Size of client route cache. If <= zero, no cache is used (server always proxies) (default: 0) [$BROKER_CACHE_SIZE]
          --broker.cache.ttl=        Time-to-live of route cache entries. (default: 1m) [$BROKER_CACHE_TTL]

[read command options]
      -l, --selector=                Label selector of journals to read
      -b, --block                    Do not exit on journal EOF; wait for new data until signaled
          --tail                     Start reading from the journal write-head (rather than offset 0)
      -o, --output=                  Output file path. Use '-' for stdout (default: -)
          --offsets=                 Path from which initial journal offsets are read at startup
          --offsets-out=             Path to which final journal offsets are written at exit
          --file-root=               Filesystem path which roots file:// fragment store
