Usage:
  gazctl [OPTIONS] journals [journals-OPTIONS] prune [prune-OPTIONS]

Deletes fragments across all configured fragment stores of matching journals that are older than the configured retention.

There is a caveat when pruning journals. For a given journal, there could be multiple fragments covering the same offset. These fragments contain identical data at a given offset, but the brokers are tracking only the largest fragment, i.e. the fragment that covers the largest span of offsets. As a result, the prune command will delete only this tracked fragment, leaving the smaller fragments untouched. As a workaround, operators can wait for the fragment listing to refresh and prune the journals again.

Use --selector to supply a LabelSelector to select journals to prune.
See "journals list --help" for details and examples.
