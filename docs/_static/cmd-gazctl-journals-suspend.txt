Usage:
  gazctl [OPTIONS] journals [journals-OPTIONS] suspend [suspend-OPTIONS]

Suspend idle journals to use fewer or zero broker replicas.

Suspension updates the 'suspend' field of the JournalSpec with its suspended
status and its resumption offset. When applying other updates to JournalSpecs,
operators utilizing journal suspension must take care to not overwrite the
journal's suspension configuration.

Typically this means reading the current JournalSpec and its ModRevision,
copying the current 'suspend' field alongside other changes being made,
and then applying the updated JournalSpec with ExpectModRevision.

The 'journals edit' subcommand uses this workflow and is safe to use with suspension.
