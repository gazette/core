Usage:
  gazctl [OPTIONS] journals [journals-OPTIONS] apply [apply-OPTIONS]

Apply a collection of JournalSpec creations, updates, or deletions.

JournalSpecs should be provided as a YAML journal hierarchy, the format
produced by "gazctl journals list". This YAML hierarchy format is sugar for
succinctly representing a collection of JournalSpecs, which typically exhibit
common prefixes and configuration. gazctl will flatten the YAML hierarchy
into the implicated collection of JournalSpec changes, and send each to the
brokers for application.

Brokers verify that the etcd "revision" field of each JournalSpec is correct,
and will fail the entire apply operation if any have since been updated. A
common operational pattern is to list, edit, and re-apply a collection of
JournalSpecs; this check ensures concurrent modifications are caught.

You may explicitly inform the broker to apply your JournalSpecs regardless of the
current state of specifications in Etcd by passing in a revision value of -1.
This commonly done when operators keep JournalSpecs in version control as their
source of truth.

JournalSpecs may be created by setting "revision" to zero or omitting altogether.

JournalSpecs may be deleted by setting field "delete" to true on individual
journals or parents thereof in the hierarchy. Note that deleted parent prefixes
will cascade only to JournalSpecs *explicitly listed* as children of the prefix
in the YAML, and not to other JournalSpecs which may exist with the prefix but
are not enumerated.

In the event that this command generates more changes than are possible in a
single Etcd transaction given the current server configuration (default 128),
gazctl supports a flag which will send changes in batches of at most
--max-txn-size. However, this means the entire apply is no longer issued as
a single Etcd transaction and it should therefore be used with caution.
If possible, prefer to use label selectors to limit the number of changes.

Application Options:
      --zone=                        Availability zone within which this process is running (default: local) [$ZONE]

Logging:
      --log.level=[info|debug|warn]  Logging level (default: info) [$LOG_LEVEL]
      --log.format=[json|text|color] Logging output format (default: text) [$LOG_FORMAT]

Help Options:
  -h, --help                         Show this help message

[journals command options]

    Broker:
          --broker.address=          Service address endpoint (default: http://localhost:8080) [$BROKER_ADDRESS]
          --broker.cache.size=       Size of client route cache. If <= zero, no cache is used (server always proxies) (default: 0) [$BROKER_CACHE_SIZE]
          --broker.cache.ttl=        Time-to-live of route cache entries. (default: 1m) [$BROKER_CACHE_TTL]

[apply command options]
          --specs=                   Input specifications path to apply. Use '-' for stdin (default: -)
          --dry-run                  Perform a dry-run of the apply
          --max-txn-size=            maximum number of specs to be processed within an apply transaction. If 0, the default, all changes are issued in a single transaction
                                     (default: 0)
