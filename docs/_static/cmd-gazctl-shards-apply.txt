Usage:
  gazctl [OPTIONS] shards [shards-OPTIONS] apply [apply-OPTIONS]

Apply a collection of ShardSpec creations, updates, or deletions.

ShardSpecs should be provided as a YAML list, the same format produced by
"gazctl shards list". Consumers verify that the Etcd "revision" field of each
ShardSpec is correct, and will fail the entire apply operation if any have since
been updated. A common operational pattern is to list, edit, and re-apply a
collection of ShardSpecs; this check ensures concurrent modifications are caught.

You may explicitly inform the broker to apply your ShardSpecs regardless of the
current state of specifications in Etcd by passing in a revision value of -1.
This commonly done when operators keep ShardSpecs in version control as their
source of truth.

ShardSpecs may be created by setting "revision" to zero or omitting it altogether.

ShardSpecs may be deleted by setting their field "delete" to true.

In the event that this command generates more changes than are possible in a
single Etcd transaction given the current server configuration (default 128),
gazctl supports a flag which will send changes in batches of at most
--max-txn-size. However, this means the entire apply is no longer issued as
a single Etcd transaction and it should therefore be used with caution.
If possible, prefer to use label selectors to limit the number of changes.
