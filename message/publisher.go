// Publisher maps, sequences, and asynchronously appends messages to Journals.
// It supports two modes of publishing: PublishCommitted and PublishUncommitted.
// Committed messages are immediately read-able by a read-committed reader.
// Uncommitted messages are immediately read-able by a read-uncommitted reader,
// but not by a read-committed reader until a future "acknowledgement" (ACK)
// message marks them as committed -- an ACK which may not ever come.
//
// To publish as a transaction, the client first issues a number of
// PublishUncommitted calls. Once all pending messages have been published,
// BuildAckIntents returns []AckIntents which will inform readers that published
// messages have committed and should be processed. To ensure atomicity of the
// published transaction, []AckIntents must be written to stable storage *before*
// being applied, and must be re-tried on fault.
//
// As a rule of thumb, API servers or other pure "producers" of events in Gazette
// should use PublishCommitted. Gazette consumers should use PublishUncommitted
// to achieve end-to-end exactly once semantics: upon commit, each consumer
// transaction will automatically acknowledge all such messages published over
// the course of the transaction.
//
// Consumers *may* instead use PublishCommitted, which may improve latency
// slightly (as read-committed readers need not wait for the consumer transaction
// to commit), but must be aware that its use weakens the effective processing
// guarantee to at-least-once.

// PublishCommitted maps the Message to a Journal and begins an AsyncAppend of
// its marshaled content, with a UUID sequenced for immediate consumption.
// An error is returned if:
//
//   - The Message implements Validator, and it returns an error.
//   - The MappingFunc returns an error while mapping the Message to a journal.
//   - The journal's Framing returns an error while marshaling the Message,
//     or an os.PathError occurs while spooling the frame to a temporary file
//     (eg, because local disk is full).
//
// A particular MappingFunc error to be aware of is ErrEmptyListResponse,
// returned by mapping routines of this package when there are no journals
// that currently match the mapping's selector. The caller may wish to retry at
// a later time in the case of ErrEmptyListResponse or os.PathError.
//
// Note that the message UUID will not yet be set when Validator or MappingFunc
// is invoked. This is because generation of UUIDs must be synchronized
// over the journal to which the Message is written to preserve ordering, and this
// cannot be known until mapping has been done.
//
// If desired, the caller may select on Done of the returned *AsyncAppend to be
// notified as soon as this particular Message has committed to the journal.
// This might be appropriate when publishing as part of an HTTP request, where
// status is to reported to the client.
//
// Callers are also free to altogether ignore the returned *AsyncAppend, perhaps
// within a non-blocking "fire and forget" of collected logs or metrics.
//
// Another option is to issue a periodic "write barrier", where the caller uses
// PendingExcept of the underlying AsyncJournalClient and waits over the returned
// OpFutures. At that time the caller is assured that all prior publishes have
// committed, without having to track or wait for them individually.
