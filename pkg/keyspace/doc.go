// Package keyspace implements an efficient mechanism to mirror a decoded Etcd
// key/value space into a local KeySpace, which may be kept updated via a long-
// lived Watch operation. Each key & value of a KeySpace is decoded with a user
// provided decoder, and validated. Clients of a KeySpace are thus ensured that
// only validated keys & values are captured, while the KeySpace maintains
// consistency of the key/value set despite the potential for validation errors.
//
// KeySpace instances may be "observed", which allows additional states to be
// derived from and updated by the KeySpace while being protected by the
// KeySpace Mutex. In other words, supposing a value updated by observing a
// KeySpace, readers are guaranteed atomicity of a combined update to the
// KeySpace and the derived value.
//
// KeySpace scales efficiently to Watches over 100's of thousands of keys by
// amortizing updates with a short Nagle-like delay, while providing fast range
// and point queries powered by its packed, sorted ordering.
