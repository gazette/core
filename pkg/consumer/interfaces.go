	// A consumer may wish to maintain in-memory state for
	// performance reasons. Examples could include:
	//  * Objects we’re reducing over, for which we wish to avoid
	//    excessive database writes.
	//  * An LRU of "hot" objects we expect to reference again soon.
	// However, to guarantee required transactionality properties,
	// consumers must be careful not to mix states between shards.

	// of a consumer-specific local memory context.

	// Current Transaction of the consumer shard. All writes issued through
	// Transaction will commit atomically and be check-pointed with consumed
	// Journal offsets. This provides exactly-once processing of Journal content
	// (though note that Gazette is itself an at-least once system, and Journal
	// writes themselves could be duplicated). Writes may be done directly to
	// the database, in which case they will be applied at-least once (for
	// example, because a Shard is recovered to a state after a write was applied
	// but before corresponding Journal offsets were written).

	// be in an unhealthy state and will be torn down.

	// Called when a consumer transaction is about to complete. If the Shard
	// Cache() contains any modified state, it must be persisted to Transaction()

	// tear-down of the Shard.

// to the Consumer that external resources or connections associated with the
