	// Gazette consumers process messages within pipelined transactions. A
	// transaction begins upon receipt of a new message from a read journal
	// at its present read offset. The message is consumed, and in the course
	// of the transaction many more messages may be read & consumed. When
	// consuming a message, the Application is free to consult the Store, to
	// publish other messages to other journals via the Shard AsyncJournalClient,
	// or to simply keep in-memory-only aggregates such as counts.
	//
	// Eventually, either because of a read stall or maximum duration, the
	// transaction will be finalized, at which point the Application must at
	// least begin any related journal writes, and must reflect any in-memory
	// caches or aggregates back into the Store.
	//
	// The offsets which have been read through are also flushed to the Store
	// at this time, and to disk, often as an atomic updates mixed with Application
	// state updates (when atomic writes are used, the framework provides an
	// exactly-once guarantee over message state updates).
	//
	// This final flush to the Store (and its recoverylog) is made dependent
	// upon all other writes issued to the AsyncJournalClient, ensuring that read
	// offsets are persisted only after related writes have completed, and thereby
	// providing an at-least once guarantee for transaction journal writes.
	//
	// Transactions are pipelined, which means that while asynchronous writes
	// from the finalized transaction run to completion, another consumer
	// transaction may begin processing concurrently. That new transaction is
	// constrained only in that it may not itself finalize until all writes
	// of its predecessor have fully committed to the brokers.
