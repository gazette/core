//
// Gazette consumers process messages within pipelined transactions. A
// transaction begins upon receipt of a new message from a read journal
// at its present read offset. The message is consumed, and in the course
// of the transaction many more messages may be read & consumed. When
// consuming a message, the Application is free to consult the Store, to
// publish other messages to other journals via the Shard AsyncJournalClient,
// or to simply keep in-memory-only aggregates such as counts.
//
// Eventually, either because of a read stall or maximum duration, the
// transaction will be finalized, at which point the Application must at
// least _start_ any related journal writes, and must reflect any in-memory
// caches or aggregates back into the Store.
//
// The offsets which have been read through are also flushed to the Store
// at this time, and to disk, often as an atomic update mixed with Application
// state updates (when atomic writes are used, the framework provides an
// exactly-once guarantee over message state updates).
//
// This final flush to the Store (and its recoverylog) is made dependent
// upon all other writes issued to the AsyncJournalClient, ensuring that read
// offsets are persisted only after related writes have completed, and thereby
// providing an at-least once guarantee for journal writes driven by the
// transaction.
//
// Transactions are pipelined, which means that while asynchronous writes
// from the finalized transaction run to completion, another consumer
// transaction may begin processing concurrently. That new transaction is
// constrained only in that it may not itself finalize until all writes of its
// predecessor have fully committed to the brokers. If that takes so long that
// the successor transaction reaches its maximum duration, then that successor
// will stall without processing further messages until all predecessor writes
// commit.

	// are pipelined, underlying journal writes of the transaction may still be
