// flowNetwork models an allocation state as a flow network, representing Items,
// "Zone Items" (which is an Item within the context of a single zone), and
// Members. Desired replication of Items, zone balancing constraints, Member
// Item limits, and a previous solution are encoded via network Arcs, their
// capacities, and priorities. Eg, zone constraints may be represented
// through intermediate "Zone Items" nodes, and a capacity from each Item which
// is one less than the desired replication (eg, not all Assignments may be in
// a single zone). Current Assignments are captured as priorities on Arcs within
// the constructed network. This modeling allows the incremental allocation
// problem to be reduced to that of obtaining a maximum flow over the resulting
// prioritized network. Pictorially, the network resembles:

// zoneScalingFactor computes a scaling factor (0, 1] which is applied to Member
// ItemLimits of a given Zone. Where there are more Member slots than Item slots,
// this balances the smaller set of Items evenly across Zones and their Members,
// rather than having some Members near or fully allocated while others are idle
// (which is an otherwise valid max-flow).
//
// The scaling factor is determined in two parts. First, we allocate a "fixed"
// number of slots for each Zone, which is the smaller of either:
//
//   * The number of Items, or
//   * The total capacity of the Zone.
//
// In other words, we never scale a Zone's capacity any lower than would allow
// us to place every Item in the Zone at least once. We arrive at a fixed
// scaling ratio which is sufficient for the Zone's fixed slots:
//
//                 min(len(Items), zoneSlots)
//   fixedRatio = ----------------------------
//                        zoneSlots
//
// Let |fixedSlots| be the sum total slots which have been allocated in this
// fashion across all Zones. Now define a "dynamic" ratio which is this Zone's
// proportionate share of remaining non-fixed Item slots:
//
//                   max(0, ItemSlots - fixedSlots)
//   dynamicRatio = ---------------------------------
//                   max(1, MemberSlots - fixedSlots)
//
// Intuitively, consider the ratio where fixedSlots = 0: it is the scaling factor
// which, when applied to MemberSlots, would adjust it to exactly match ItemSlots.
// Where fixedSlots > 0, the ratio adjusts the non-fixed remainder of MemberSlots
// to exactly match the non-fixed remainder of ItemSlots. Compose both ratios
// for the final scaling ratio:
//
//   zoneRatio = fixedRatio + (1 - fixedRatio) * dynamicRatio
//
// zoneScalingFactors expands this expression to return the ratio as
// separate integer numerator & denominator components.
