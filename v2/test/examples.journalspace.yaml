# Journal YAMLs represent a hierarchy of related journals.
# Intermediate nodes of the hierarchy are directories (indicated by a trailing
# '/' in their name), and terminal nodes represent journals (which never
# have a trailing '/'). For the YAML to validate, all node names in the
# hierarchy must be prefixed by that of their parent(s).
#
# An important concept to understand is that journal hierarchies don't
# actually exist, from a system perspective: every journal is written to
# Etcd with its full and complete JournalSpec. The gazctl tool maps a
# journal YAML to complete JournalSpecs by pushing configuration from parent
# to child. In other words, where a journal provides no value for a
# configuration property, it derives the value of the lowest parent in the
# tree which specifies a non-zero value (labels are additively merged).
# gazctl derives a YAML from a set of matched JournalSpecs by "hoisting"
# properties shared by all children to a representative parent node.

# Root directory of this journal YAML.

# Replication is the number of brokers required to participate in write

# failure zones.

  # Stores enumerates the fragment backing stores of the journal. More
  # than one store may be provided. New fragments are always persisted
