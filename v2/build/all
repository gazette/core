# This script builds gazette and its examples. It is intended for use both by
# devs for local builds and by CI for automated builds.
#
# There is special case handling for builds executed by CircleCI. In that
# case, the build process will pull and use liveramp/gazette-vendor as a cache
# source since the local build cache is not persisted across CircleCI jobs.
# This script will push changes to liveramp/gazette-vendor on builds of the
# master branch.
#
# Usage: ./all PROJECT_DIR
#
# Globals:
#   - DOCKER_USER: Username for Docker Hub, a.k.a. Docker ID.
#   - DOCKER_PASS: Password for DOCKER_USER.
#
#  Both globals are only required when in CircleCI.
#
# Arguments:
#   - PROJECT_DIR: The path to the Gazette project root.
#
# Example:
#   ./v2/build/all .
