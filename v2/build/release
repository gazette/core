# This script builds and publishes Gazette docker images: liveramp/gazette and
# liveramp/gazette-examples. It will tag the newly built images as "latest"
# and a version (e.g., major.minor.patch). It is intended to be executed by
# CircleCI when an official release is tagged in GitHub where the git tag
# becomes the docker image version tag with the leading "v" removed.
#
# Usage: ./release PROJECT_DIR VERSION_TAG
#
# Globals:
#   - DOCKER_USER: Username for Docker Hub, a.k.a. Docker ID.
#   - DOCKER_PASS: Password for DOCKER_USER.
#
# Arguments:
#   - PROJECT_DIR: The path to the Gazette project root.
#   - VERSION_TAG: The GitHub release tag.
#
# Example:
#   ./v2/build/release . v7.8.9

readonly ROOT="${1?project root dir required}"
# Document: Expect this to be "vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH".

# Strip "v" prefix from GitHub release. While it is conventional for GitHub
# release tags to be prefixed with a "v", it is conventional for image tags
# representing versions on Docker Hub to not be.
readonly IMAGE_TAG="${RELEASE_TAG/#v/}"
