table: Prints as a table (see other flags for column choices)

typically, common configuration. This hierarchy is simply sugar for and is

JournalSpecs should be provided as a YAML journal hierarchy, the format

succinctly representing a collection of JournalSpecs, which typically exhibit
common prefixes and configuration. gazctl will flatten the YAML hierarchy
into the implicated collection of JournalSpec changes, and send each to the
brokers for application.

Brokers verify that the etcd "revision" field of each JournalSpec is correct,
and will fail the entire apply operation if any have since been updated. A
common operational pattern is to list, edit, and re-apply a collection of
JournalSpecs; this check ensures concurrent modifications are caught.

JournalSpecs may be created by setting "revision" to zero or omitting altogether.

JournalSpecs may be deleted by setting field "delete" to true on individual
journals or parents thereof in the hierarchy. Note that deleted parent prefixes
will cascade only to JournalSpecs *explicitly listed* as children of the prefix
in the YAML, and not to other JournalSpecs which may exist with the prefix but
are not enumerated.
