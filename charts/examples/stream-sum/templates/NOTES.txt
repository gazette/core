The `stream-sum` example is now running. The `summer` consumers consume chunks of data streams emitted by `chunker`
jobs to the `examples/stream-sum/chunks` topic. When a stream completes, the `summer` emits a final computed sum to
the `examples/stream-sum/sums` journal. The `chunker` jobs inspect this journal and verify expected sums match,
and exit normally when all streams have been completed and verified.

For extra fun, `summer` pods and `gazette` brokers can be terminated or hard-killed, and the example _must_ still
complete successfully. The `chunker` jobs and `summer` pods will crash loudly if a detected invariant is violated
(eg, messages arrive out-of-order or are altogether missing, computed sums are incorrect, etc).
